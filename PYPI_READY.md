## ðŸš€ Upload to PyPI

### Step 1: Install Upload Tools
```bash
pip install build twine
```

### Step 2: Build the Package
```bash
cd /Users/leo/aecf
python -m build
```

### Step 3: Upload to Test PyPI (Recommended First)
```bash
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

### Step 4: Test Installation from Test PyPI
```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ aecf
```

### Step 5: Upload to Production PyPI
```bash
twine upload dist/*
```

- `minimal_test.py` - Test script
- `show_improvements.py` - Comparison script
- `visualization_summary.py` - Analysis script
- `*.pt` files - PyTorch model files
- `*.parquet` files - Data files
- `aecf/coco_tests/` - Test directory
- `aecf/datasets.py` - Dataset utilities (not core functionality)

## ðŸ”§ Package Configuration

- **Name**: aecf

## ðŸ“– Usage After Installation

```python
# Install via pip (once uploaded)
pip install aecf

# Use in your code
import torch
from aecf import create_fusion_pool

# Create fusion components
fusion_query, attention_pool = create_fusion_pool(
    embed_dim=512,
    num_modalities=3,
    mask_prob=0.15
)

# Use in your model
batch_size = 32
modalities = torch.randn(batch_size, 3, 512)
expanded_query = fusion_query.expand(batch_size, -1, -1)
fused_features = attention_pool(expanded_query, modalities)
```

## ðŸ”„ Updates for Your URLs

Remember to update these URLs in `pyproject.toml` before uploading:
- `https://github.com/your-username/aecf` â†’ Your actual GitHub repo
- `your.email@example.com` â†’ Your actual email
